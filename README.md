First set of folders is the specific course I took, the subfolders represent separate projects I did as part of the curriculum.  I will copy/paste the files such that you can run my code and see the completed projects, although this is more to save things for my own benefit.
NOTE ALSO: There are a large number of non-project assignments I do for these certifications, like reading, quizzes, labs and guided workshops, all of which also help build experience.  I have more experience than just the code I copy into this repository, I'm keeping it as a resource I can look back on to review design elements for the future, and as examples of work I have completed in the past.
