First set of folders is the specific course I took, the subfolders represent separate projects I did as part of the curriculum.  I will copy/paste the files such that you can run my code and see the completed projects, although this is more to save things for my own benefit.  Each project will include the files I used to make it, which will allow it to be reviewable on a live server (I use a vscode extension to ensure the results are the same here as on the site that tests my projects for passing), as well as a list of the requirements I was given for each project so it can be compared to the results.
NOTE ALSO: There are a large number of non-project assignments I do for these certifications, like reading, quizzes, labs and guided workshops, all of which also help build experience.  I have more experience than just the code I copy into this repository, I'm keeping it as a resource I can look back on to review design elements for the future, and as examples of work I have completed in the past.
